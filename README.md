- The Workflow Description Language (WDL or 'widdle') is an open source scripting language which allows you to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. 
- [WDL](https://openwdl.org/) was originally developed for genomics, but can be extended to other domains. 
- This repository contains educational materials for learning to read and write WDL scripts.

## Execution Engines
WDL is not executable in and of itself, but requires an execution engine to run. Compliant executions engines should support the features of a specific version of the WDL specification. Please see the linked engine documentation for information on available execution options and support.

 - [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) - **IMPORTANT** This Repo uses `cromwell-50.jar` for testing all WDL example scripts
 - [MiniWDL](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl)
