- The Workflow Description Language (WDL or 'widdle') is an [open source scripting language](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) which allows you to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. 
- [WDL](https://openwdl.org/) was originally developed for genomics, but can be extended to other domains.  
- This repository contains educational materials for learning to read and write WDL scripts.

## Execution Environments

WDL is not executable in and of itself, but requires an execution engine and environment to be runnable. Compliant executions engines should support the features of a specific version of the WDL specification. Please see the linked engine documentation for information on available execution options and support. Some of the linked environments include WDL linting and parsing tools as well.

 - [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) - **IMPORTANT** This Repo uses `cromwell-50.jar` for testing all WDL example scripts
 - [MiniWDL](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl) - Workflow Description Language local runner & developer toolkit for Python 3.6+
 - [dxWDL](https://github.com/dnanexus/dxWDL) - takes a pipeline written in WDL and compiles it to an equivalent workflow on the DNAnexus platform. WDL draft-2, version 1.0, and the development version are supported
 - [wdlTools](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/wdlTools) - Scala programming language library for parsing WDL, and command-line tools for type-checking, code formatting, and more.
